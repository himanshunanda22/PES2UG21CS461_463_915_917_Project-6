# E-commerce Microservices Application

This project aims to develop an e-commerce microservices application that can be deployed on the cloud using Docker, Kubernetes, Jenkins, and Git.

## Project Overview

The application consists of several microservices deployed as Docker containers on a Kubernetes cluster. Jenkins is used for continuous integration and deployment, while Git is used for version control.

## Microservices

The application includes the following microservices:

1. **User Management**: Handles user registration, authentication, and authorization.
2. **Product Management**: Handles product management, including adding, editing, and deleting products.
3. **Order Management**: Handles order management, including viewing order history, tracking orders, and managing orders.
4. **Review Management (optional)**: Handles product review management, allowing users to view and add reviews.

## Technologies Used

- **Docker**: For containerization of microservices.
- **Kubernetes**: For orchestration and deployment of containers.
- **Jenkins**: For continuous integration and deployment.
- **Git**: For version control and code management.

## Project Structure

The project is structured as follows:

- user-service/: Contains the user management microservice.
- product-service/: Contains the product management microservice.
- order-service/: Contains the order management microservice.
- review-service/: Contains the review management microservice - (optional).
- kubernetes/: Contains Kubernetes deployment manifests and service definitions.
- jenkins/: Contains Jenkins configuration files and Jenkinsfile for the CI/CD pipeline.


- Each microservice has its own directory containing the source code and a `Dockerfile` for building the Docker image.
- The `kubernetes/` directory contains the Kubernetes deployment manifests and service definitions.
- The `jenkins/` directory contains the Jenkins configuration files and `Jenkinsfile` for the CI/CD pipeline.

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/e-commerce-microservices.git

2. Build and run the Docker images for each microservice:
cd e-commerce-microservices/user-service
docker build -t user-service .
docker run -p 8080:8080 user-service

Repeat this process for each microservice.

3. Set up Kubernetes and deploy the microservices using the provided manifests.

4. Configure Jenkins and set up the CI/CD pipeline for automated builds and deployments.
